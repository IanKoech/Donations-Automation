        <div>
            <p>We are a non-profit organisation that helps various charities get funding from 
                donors and also allows donors to pledge their conrtibution. We store donor and charity 
                details inside a database. We also provide donors with the option of anonymity. Donors whose
                details are saved and had previously pledged to make a donation will be reminded when to make the
                donation.
